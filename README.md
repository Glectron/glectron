# Glectron minimal implementation
This branch contains the minimal implementation of Glectron concepts. You **shouldn't** use the code here to make a new addon.

The implementation mainly targets at the language interop part and only planned to support Chromium (x86-64).

Garbage collection is not considered in this minimal implementation.
